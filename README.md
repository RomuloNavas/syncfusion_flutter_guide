This is great if want to display a graphic from some data that you are receiving at a high speed. So you don't update the graphic every time you receive a new value, you update the graphic by a timer.

- Add a single value at the chart
- Add a multiple values at the chart
- Remove a value at the beginning of the chart
- Remove a multiple values at the beginning of the chart
- Remove a value at the end of the chart
- Remove multiple values and add multiple values at the same time
- A timer to every amount of ms, add new values and remove old ones, to have a nice looking scrolling with a good performance.
